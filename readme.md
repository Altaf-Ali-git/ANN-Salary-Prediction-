# Customer Expected Salary Prediction using ANN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** model trained on a **Churn Dataset** to predict the **Expected Salary of customers**.  
The complete solution is divided into three major components:

1. **Model Training**
2. **Model Prediction**
3. **Visualization & Deployment using Streamlit**

The application allows users to input customer-related details and receive a predicted expected salary through an interactive web interface.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Predicting a customer’s expected salary based on historical and demographic data helps businesses in:
- Better customer segmentation
- Targeted marketing strategies
- Financial planning and analysis

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Model Training
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features)
- Building an ANN using TensorFlow/Keras
- Training the model on the churn dataset
- Saving the trained model for future inference

### 2️⃣ Model Prediction
- Loading the trained ANN model
- Taking new customer inputs
- Predicting the expected salary based on learned patterns

### 3️⃣ Visualization & Deployment
- Developed an interactive UI using **Streamlit**
- Users can input customer details through the web app
- Real-time salary prediction output is displayed
